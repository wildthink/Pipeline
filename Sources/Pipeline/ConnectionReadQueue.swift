/// ensure they occur one at a time in FIFO order.  This provides thread-safe
/// access to the database connection.
///
/// Database read operations may be submitted for synchronous or asynchronous execution.
///
/// It is possible to maintain a consistent snapshot of a database using read
/// transactions. Changes committed to a database are not visible within a read transaction
/// until the transaction is updated or restarted.
///
/// The interface is similar to `DispatchQueue` and a dispatch queue is used
